<h1>How Can You Help?</h1>

<p>
    At this time we are not quite ready to accept help directly from the community.  There are other ways you can help
    us all in the meantime.

<p>
    Nothing beats hands-on experience helping with an existing Food Forest Project.  In exchange for your time you will
    learn a lot about plants and help build something at the same time.  Find a local project, or one you can visit.
