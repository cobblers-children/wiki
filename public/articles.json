        "At this time we are not quite ready to accept help directly from the community. There are other ways you can help us all in the meantime.",
        "## Pictures",
        "Good pictures of plants are going to be one of the hardest things to come by.  If you have access to plants and a good eye, start taking pictures.  We'll need them soon, but it'll take some time before we can accept uploads.",
        "## Volunteer",
        "Nothing beats hands-on experience helping with an existing Food Forest Project.  In exchange for your time you will learn a lot about plants and help build something at the same time.  Find a local project, or one you can visit.",
